Description: This webpage creates a multiplication table completely dynamically based on 
parameters entered in an HTML form via the form of jQuery slider widgets. The webpage will
validate these inputs using the jquery.validate.js plugin. Then, every time a new table is generated,
it will be displayed in a new tab and labeled with the four parameters used to create it.
